5. 




'm thinking that you create a website that ties into the Twitter API and ChatAds API.  The Twitter API pulls in 100% random tweets and runs them against the ChatAds API to try and find a match.  (The Tweets act as if they were Text Messages).

Once there's a match, the Website displays the original tweet and the Matched/returned ChatAds "Category" with Keyword below.

There's also a <<Check Mark>> and <<X>> buttons displayed.  (Bonus: Tie the left and right keyboard arrows into the equation as well).

The User sees both the original tweet and the ChatAds "Category" and Keyword.  If the match is a Good Match, the user clicks on the <<Check Mark>> button (or presses the Left Arrow); if the match is incorrect, the user clicks on the <<X>> button (or presses the right arrow button).

Incorrect matches are sent to Buster via a spreadsheet of some sort.
